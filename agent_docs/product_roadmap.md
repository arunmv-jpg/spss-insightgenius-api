# Indico Crosstab — Product Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-04-05

## Vision

The **Stripe of market research** — a deterministic statistical engine that developers integrate to build their own Displayr-like products. The product IS the API. Frontends are convenience wrappers and starter templates.

## Completed Sprints

### Sprint 1-6 (Mar 18-23): Foundation
7→14 endpoints, QuantipyMRX engine, MCP server (12 tools), embedded UI, 68 tests.

### Sprint 7: Enterprise Hardening (Mar 28)
Bonferroni significance, idempotency middleware, error standardization, key management, usage metering, concurrency controls.

### Sprint 8: MCP v2 + API v2 (Mar 28)
22 MCP tools, 52 REST endpoints (v1+v2), shared `executeCodingPipeline()`, deployed.

### Sprint 9: Nested Banners + Wave Compare + Stub Filters (Mar-Apr)
Nested banners (cross-product), wave comparison (z/t-test), stub filters, CI pipeline, OpenAPI spec.

### Sprint 10: 4 CRITICAL Security Fixes (Apr 5)
1. Library IDOR → auth + ownership on all 8 endpoints
2. PyJWT fallback bypass → removed unverified decode
3. CORS wildcard → restricted to explicit origins
4. MCP anonymous access → auth_required on empty key

### Sprint 11: Enterprise Audit + Quick Wins (Apr 5)
7-agent audit (Security, API, Performance, Dead Code, Test Coverage, Playwright E2E, MCP Live).
Score: 6.5/10 → 7.5/10 after fixes:
- Auth on file upload, ownership on 3 library endpoints
- Error boundaries on wave_compare + smart_spec
- PostgREST query sanitization
- Security headers (HSTS, nosniff, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- Dead code cleanup (-1830 lines, deleted schemas/, smart_labeler, request_id)
- BaseHTTPMiddleware → pure ASGI (fixed Railway deploy crashes)
- python-pptx restored (transitive dependency of quantipymrx)

### Sprint A: Developer Experience (Apr 5, in progress)
- npm SDK (`@indicolabs/crosstab-sdk`) — 13 types, all 28 methods, MSW tests
- Async webhooks — job store, `/v1/jobs/{id}`, webhook delivery
- Next.js template (pending)
- Developer portal page (pending)

## Competitive Position

> "Displayr charges $175/mo per seat. WinCross charges $3-5K/year. SPSS $99/mo per seat. All are closed monoliths. We are the **Stripe of market research** — an API that anyone can integrate. A developer with Lovable builds their own Displayr in a weekend using our engine."
