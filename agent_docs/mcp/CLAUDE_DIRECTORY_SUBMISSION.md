## Form Fields — Copy-Paste Ready

### Server Name
```
Indico Crosstab
```

### Server URL (SSE endpoint)
```
https://crosstab.indicolabs.io/mcp/sse
```

Note: SSE transport. Streamable HTTP is not yet supported due to a FastMCP limitation
when mounting as sub-app in FastAPI (anyio task group not initialized). Migration planned
when FastMCP adds standalone-mount support.

### Brief Description (1-2 sentences)
```
Analyze survey data (.sav, .csv, .xlsx) through Claude — crosstabs with significance testing, ANOVA, correlation, gap analysis, and publication-ready Excel exports. Upload once, analyze unlimited.
```

### Detailed Description
```
Indico Crosstab lets market researchers analyze survey data by talking to Claude instead of wrestling with desktop software. Upload an SPSS (.sav), CSV, or Excel file once and run unlimited analyses through 13 specialized tools.

What it does:
- Frequency tables with mean, standard deviation, and median
- Cross-tabulations with column proportion z-test significance letters (A/B/C notation)
- Correlation matrices (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall) with p-values
- One-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc comparisons
- Importance-Performance gap analysis with quadrant classification
- Satisfaction summaries (Top 2 Box / Bottom 2 Box / Mean)
- Zero-config auto-analyze: AI detects banners, groups MRS/Grid variables, applies nets, generates complete Excel
- Professional Excel tabulation export with significance letters, nets, means, MRS groups, and Grid/Battery summaries

Every response includes structured content_blocks (title, key_finding, data_table_markdown) designed for composability — pipe results directly to Gamma, PowerPoint, Canva, or any presentation tool.

File sessions: upload once, analyze many times. No re-uploading 50MB files on every query. 30-minute sliding TTL.
```

### Features List
```
- Upload once, analyze unlimited: File sessions with 30-min sliding TTL (Redis-backed)
- 13 analysis tools: frequencies, crosstabs, correlation, ANOVA, gap analysis, satisfaction summary, auto-analyze, tabulation, export, metadata, variable profiling
- Multi-format: .sav (SPSS), .csv, .tsv, .xlsx, .xls with auto-detection
- Significance testing: Column proportion z-test at 90/95/99% confidence with letter notation
- Zero-config auto-analyze: Upload a file, get complete Excel with AI-detected banners, MRS groups, grids, and nets
- Composable responses: content_blocks in every response for direct use with Gamma, PowerPoint, Canva, or any presentation tool
- Professional Excel output: Publication-ready workbooks with significance letters, dual bases, nets, means, MRS, and Grid summaries
- Download URLs: Temporary 5-minute links for Excel files (n8n/Make compatible)
- Batch analysis: Analyze up to 50 variables in a single frequency call
```

### Authentication Type
```
API Key (Bearer token for Streamable HTTP, or api_key parameter for SSE)
```

### Authentication Details
```
API keys in format sk_test_... or sk_live_... Keys are SHA256-hashed server-side — raw keys never stored.

Streamable HTTP: Authorization: Bearer sk_live_... header on the HTTP connection.
SSE transport: api_key passed as parameter in each tool call (SSE has no header support).

Users obtain keys at https://crosstab.indicolabs.io. The api_key parameter pattern on SSE is a deliberate design choice due to SSE transport limitations — SSE connections don't support custom headers in all MCP clients.
```

### Test Credentials (for Anthropic QA team)
```
API Key: Contact support@indicolabs.io for a test key
Plan: Pro (60 requests/min, 50MB max file)
Scopes: All (metadata, frequency, crosstab, process, convert, parse_ticket)

SSE endpoint: https://crosstab.indicolabs.io/mcp/sse (api_key as tool parameter)
Health check: https://crosstab.indicolabs.io/v1/health

To test with MCP Inspector:
  npx @anthropic-ai/mcp-inspector https://crosstab.indicolabs.io/mcp/sse

Quick test: call spss_get_server_info with api_key to verify connectivity.
The server accepts CSV and Excel files for testing without SPSS software.

Note: This test key has strict rate limits (60/min) and is revocable.
```

### Connection Instructions (for Claude Desktop / Claude.ai)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "indico_crosstab": {
      "url": "https://crosstab.indicolabs.io/mcp/sse"
    }
  }
}
```
Note: SSE transport — api_key is passed as parameter in each tool call.
This is a deliberate design choice: SSE connections don't support custom
headers in all MCP clients, so auth is at the tool-call level.

For Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse indico_crosstab https://crosstab.indicolabs.io/mcp/sse
```

## Required: Minimum 3 Working Examples

### Example 1: Quick Frequency Analysis
```
User: "I have a customer satisfaction survey. What's the distribution of overall satisfaction?"

Claude calls: spss_upload_file(api_key="sk_test_...", file_base64="[base64 of survey.sav]", filename="survey.sav")
→ Returns: {file_id: "abc123", n_cases: 1000, n_variables: 19}

Claude calls: spss_analyze_frequencies(api_key="sk_test_...", file_id="abc123", variables=["sat_overall"])
→ Returns: {
    insight_summary: "Overall satisfaction: most common is 'Satisfied' (35.3%, n=1000)",
    content_blocks: {
      title: "Satisfaction Distribution",
      key_finding: "'Satisfied' is the most common response (35.3%)",
      data_table_markdown: "| Rating | % | Count |\n|---|---|---|\n| Very satisfied | 34.2% | 342 |..."
    },
    results: [{ variable: "sat_overall", frequencies: [...], mean: 3.72 }]
  }

Claude responds: "Your satisfaction data shows a positive skew — 35.3% of respondents are 'Satisfied' and 34.2% are 'Very satisfied', giving you a combined Top 2 Box of 69.5%. The mean satisfaction score is 3.72 on the 5-point scale."
```

### Example 2: Cross-tabulation with Significance Testing
```
User: "Compare satisfaction across regions. Are there significant differences?"

Claude calls: spss_get_metadata(api_key="sk_test_...", file_id="abc123")
→ Identifies region as a suggested banner variable

Claude calls: spss_analyze_crosstab(api_key="sk_test_...", file_id="abc123", row="sat_overall", col="region", significance_level=0.95, include_means=true)
→ Returns: {
    insight_summary: "Significant relationship (chi2 p=0.013). London leads with 68.6% T2B.",
    content_blocks: {
      title: "Satisfaction by Region",
      key_finding: "London significantly higher than Scotland (68.6% vs 50.4%)",
      data_table_markdown: "| | London (A) n=198 | Scotland (B) n=212 | Wales (C) n=386 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Very satisfied | 45.2% BC | 31.1% | 28.8% |..."
    },
    results: { chi2_pvalue: 0.013, table: [...], means: {...} }
  }

Claude responds: "There are significant regional differences in satisfaction (chi-square p=0.013). London leads with 68.6% Top 2 Box — significantly higher than both Scotland (50.4%) and Wales (53.2%). The mean satisfaction in London (4.2) is also significantly above the other regions."
```

### Example 3: Zero-Config Auto-Analyze with Excel Export
```
User: "Just analyze everything in this file and give me the Excel."

Claude calls: spss_upload_file(api_key="sk_test_...", file_base64="[base64 of haircare_study.sav]", filename="haircare_study.sav")
→ Returns: {file_id: "xyz789", n_cases: 493, n_variables: 291}

Claude calls: spss_auto_analyze(api_key="sk_test_...", file_id="xyz789")
→ Returns: {
    download_url: "https://crosstab.indicolabs.io/downloads/tmp_abc.xlsx",
    download_expires_in_seconds: 300,
    stubs_processed: 62,
    banners_used: ["age_group"],
    tables_summary: [
      {stub: "F1", stub_label: "Gender", base_total: 493, top_finding: "100% Male"},
      {stub: "Q1", stub_label: "Overall Satisfaction", base_total: 493, top_finding: "T2B 72%"}
    ],
    insight_summary: "Tabulation complete: 62 tables across 1 banner (age_group).",
    content_blocks: {
      slides: [
        {title: "Methodology", content: "n=493, banner: age_group"},
        {title: "Overall Satisfaction", content: "72% Top 2 Box..."}
      ]
    }
  }

Claude responds: "Done! I auto-detected age_group as the best banner and generated 62 crosstab tables with significance testing. Here's the download link for your Excel (valid for 5 minutes): [link]. Key finding: Overall satisfaction T2B is 72%."
